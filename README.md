## Introduction

Donuts Shooter is a unique and entertaining multiplayer FPS game where players take on the role of adorable donuts. Engage in intense battles with your friends or other players in two exciting game modes: "Gun-Master" and "Deathmatch." Show off your shooting skills, level up your arsenal, and dominate the battlefield.

## Game Modes

### Gun-Master Mode

In Gun-Master mode, every kill you score advances you to a new weapon, with the weapon selection being determined by the server settings. Climb through the ranks as you eliminate opponents and become the ultimate donut gunslinger.

### Deathmatch Mode

Deathmatch mode allows you to use your predefined customized loadouts to eliminate your enemies. Choose your preferred weapons and gear before the match begins, and strategize to claim victory for your team.

## Server Setup

Anyone can host a server with either of the game modes and configure the number of teams and map selection. The individual who creates the server becomes the admin, and anyone can join that server to participate in thrilling donut battles.

## Registration and Login

To enhance your gaming experience, Donuts Shooter features a registration and login system. Create an account to keep track of your progress, stats, and achievements. Never lose your hard-earned donut customization and loadouts again!

## Customization

Express your creativity and style by customizing your donut's colors and your player's loadouts. Stand out on the battlefield with a unique look while wielding your favorite weapons.

## Weapon's Stats

Strategic decision-making is vital in Donuts Shooter, and that's why we've implemented a comprehensive weapon's stats system. Compare various weapons, such as fire rate, accuracy, and more, to choose the perfect loadout that suits your playstyle.

## Main Programming Concepts

Donuts Shooter incorporates some key programming concepts to ensure a smooth and immersive gaming experience:

- **Object Pooling**: We utilize object pooling for bullets to optimize performance and improve gameplay.

- **Scriptable Objects**: Weapon's stats are managed using Scriptable Objects, allowing easy comparison and management of various weapon attributes.

## How to Play

- Launch the game and log in with your account or create a new one.
- Customize your donut's colors and set up your loadouts.
- Join an existing server or create your own and invite friends to play.
